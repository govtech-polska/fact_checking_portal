  "title": "How do we verify the information?",
  "description": "You can find a lot of fake information on the Internet these days. The sheer scale of this process led us to the point where we needed to turn for help to the others in order to properly fight this phenomenon. The verification alone, on the other hand, cannot entail any indication of an institution or private opinion. The main idea of this project is to invite the volunteers from all over the country, who were trained on checking the facts and the use of the whole system before. It is they as well as PAP journalists who will verify the requests sent to them via special app from Internet users. Before the checked information will go public, two unanimous decisions from our volunteers or one verdict from PAP worker must be made. The journalists while making the final verdict will check the selection and reliability of sources used by the social ‘fake hunters’. After a detailed analysis they will make the final decision and also inform the volunteers.",
